Hello Programmers and Coders üíª,

I am Arsharaj Chauhan. Some of you know me and if not then you can checkout my [Github](https://github.com/arsharaj) profile. I am a programming freak and I love coding things. I prefer messaging over talking as it is more to the point. Currently, I am in second year of my B.Tech.

I am particularly interested in ?. I am still searching for that specific thing. Though, I make websites, mobile applications and sometimes when I am free from all of these then I also do Competitive Programming. 

My favorite hobby is reading. But since engineering books cost high so I started learning online and taking different courses. After all learning doesn't  need any excuse. I like to study things in details. Sometimes, I also listen to podcasts. [Command Line Heroes](https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes) is my favourite.

Now, since I also want to share my knowledge and wisdom with this world so I made this blog. I get my inspiration from the Computer Researchers and Developers. This blog is specifically dedicated for my experiences and studies in Computer Science branch. I will share my experiences, studies, best practices with you all. I discuss some of the advanced topics since nobody wants to be a beginner anymore.

You will surely get great content !!

You can contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/arsharajchauhan), [Github](https://github.com/arsharaj) for any relevant information.

Wait wait, one more thing, Welcome to my World üòÅ. This is essential.
